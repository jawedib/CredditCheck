# CredditCheck

Currently live at: https://credditcheck.herokuapp.com/

Reddit user credibility checker. Web app version of the my Reddit bot. Personal project to get familiar with Django, Bootstrap and Jinja. 
Purpose of the bot is to gauge the credibility of a user without having to go through their comment history. Obviously, it's Reddit, it’s user-voted and more about overall agreeability and not actual credibility but CredditCheck is a much cooler name. 

This tool can also used by marketers who often buy out Reddit accounts to promote their products. Of course, I do not condone the act of buying out accounts for promotional purposes but it still happens. Some buyers are most likely using this kind of a tool already. On the positive side, it can be used by marketers outside of the grey area too. For example, a brand may use this tool and decide to approach Neil Degrasse Tyson instead of Bill Nye to promote their product on Reddit. The grades of both of these science-celebs as of 14 Jan 2019 are:

•	Neil Tyson(Reddit username: neiltyson) : A+
•	Bill Nye(Reddit username: sundialbill): B

If I had to guess beforehand, I would guess the opposite scores as Bill Nye has been overall better liked celebrity at Reddit. It was just lately his account has been subject to negative responses by Reddit users due to several reasons explained here by other users(may contain foul language):

As a marketer, I could skip all of this research by simply using CredditChecker!



UPDATE(6th January 2019) : I was looking to move from PRAW API to PushShift for quicker, more consistent results but apparently they might not be around for much longer so we'll stay with PRAW for now.
